In the fall of 2017, I learned and practiced the principles of type design at Type@Cooper West, instructed by Graham Bradley. Over the course of 10 weeks, I worked on bringing my super bold, reverse-contrast typeface to life using RoboFont.

Because this was only 10 weeks, there is a lot more work to do â€” more characters to draw, more spacing to fix, more proofs to print, and more techniques to learn. This introductory foundation helped me think about how letterforms are drawn, designed and exist within relation to each other. I'm excited to continue learning and designing more.

Our class was fortunate to have James Edmondson and Christine Strohl as guest critics for our last class. It meant a lot for James to critique my work since he seems to be the reigning champ of funky typefaces.
